      <p>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? New-new-Doctor. Allons-y! Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me!
